Each document in this collection represents a single form submission, identified by a unique ID. The structure ensures authorization independence by storing all necessary data within each entry document. Since authentication is optional, the `userId` field can be empty. All documents within the `crop_data` collection share the same security requirements, which simplifies the security rules. This structure supports listing all entries for a specific user, by filtering by `userId` (for authenticated users) and enables QAPs since rules are not filters."
