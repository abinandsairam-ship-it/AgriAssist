/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for `crop_data` entries, allowing only the creating user to modify or delete their own entries.
 * History entries are open to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/crop_data/{entryId}`: Stores user-submitted form entries. Each entry contains a `userId` field indicating ownership.
 * - `/history/{historyId}`: Stores a log of user actions and events. These are considered public read but deny write.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, update, and delete entries they own.
 * - Listing and getting entries in crop_data is open to all.
 * - The `history` collection is readable by all but denies write access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `crop_data` entries denormalize the `userId` field directly onto the document to enable efficient ownership checks without additional reads.
