/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access to crop data submitted by users.
 * It allows public read access to the crop_data collection but restricts write access to authenticated users only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All crop data entries are stored in the top-level `/crop_data/{entryId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Allows all users (including unauthenticated ones) to read the data in `/crop_data`.
 * - Owner-Only Writes: Restricts the creation, update, and deletion of crop data entries to authenticated users. The `userId` field in each document must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - No User Listing: Listing users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each document in the `/crop_data` collection has a `userId` field, which is used to enforce ownership for write operations. This avoids the need for additional `get()` calls to determine ownership.

     * @allow (update, delete): An authenticated user can update or delete a crop data entry if the userId matches their UID and the document exists.
     * @deny (create): An unauthenticated user cannot create a crop data entry.
     * @deny (update, delete): An unauthenticated user cannot update or delete a crop data entry. An authenticated user cannot update or delete another user's crop data entry.
     * @principle Allows public data consumption with authenticated user-based ownership for modification.
