/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for `crop_data` entries,
 * ensuring that only the user who created an entry can modify or delete it.
 * The `history` collection is read-only and intended for auditing purposes,
 * therefore only allows `get` and `list` operations for authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/crop_data/{entryId}`: Stores individual crop data entries. Each entry
 *   must have a `userId` field matching the authenticated user's UID.
 * - `/history/{historyId}`: Stores historical events.  Access is restricted
 *   to authenticated users for reading. Writes are not allowed through the rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of `history` collection allowed for any signed in user, which is a potential security risk, however
 * the prompt's error is fixed by allowing signed in users to `list` the `/history` endpoint.
 * - Data type and presence validation is skipped to allow for rapid prototyping and
 *   schema iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `crop_data` documents contain a `userId` field.  This is used to
 *   quickly verify ownership without needing additional `get()` calls.
