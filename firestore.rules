/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Agriassist Firestore database.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on user authentication.
 * It focuses on protecting user-submitted form entries and maintaining an audit log of user actions.
 *
 * @dataStructure:
 * The database contains two top-level collections: `crop_data` and `history`.
 * - `crop_data`: Stores user-submitted form entries with AI-generated predictions. Documents are identified by a unique entry ID.
 * - `history`: Stores an audit log of user actions and events, with each event having a unique ID.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions:
 * - All write operations on `crop_data` and `history` require user authentication.
 * - Public listing of `crop_data` is enabled.
 * - Public listing of `history` is disabled to prevent unauthorized access to audit logs.
 * - No role-based access control is implemented in this iteration.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization:
 * The `crop_data` documents contain a `userId` field to associate the entry with the user who created it, enabling ownership-based access control.
