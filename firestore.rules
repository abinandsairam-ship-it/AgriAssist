/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for form entries. Only authenticated
 * users can create, update, or delete their own entries. Anonymous users can submit
 * forms but cannot modify them later.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All form entries are stored in the top-level `/crop_data/{entryId}` collection.
 * Each document contains a `userId` field that links it to the user who created it.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public listing of entries is allowed.
 * - Only the owner of an entry can update or delete it.
 * - Anonymous users can create entries, but the `userId` field must be an empty string.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields for prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field is denormalized directly onto the `/crop_data/{entryId}` document to
 * avoid needing to perform additional `get()` operations to check ownership.

     * @allow (create): An authenticated user can create a new entry with their userId. An anonymous user can create an entry with an empty userId.
     * @allow (update, delete): Only the user who created the entry can update or delete it.
     * @deny (create): An authenticated user cannot create an entry with a userId that does not match their own.
     * @deny (update, delete): A user cannot update or delete an entry that does not exist.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for writes and public read access.
