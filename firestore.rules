/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for form entries. Authenticated users can create entries,
 * and only the creating user can modify or delete their own entries. Unauthenticated users can also create entries anonymously, 
 * but only the creating user can modify or delete their own entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data resides in the `/crop_data/{entryId}` collection. Each entry contains information about a user-submitted form.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own entries.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed to allow for rapid iteration and prototyping. Only the `userId` field is validated on create to enforce ownership.
 * - Read access to the `/crop_data` collection is public.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` field is included directly within each `/crop_data/{entryId}` document to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *   This denormalization allows for efficient authorization checks based on user ID.

     * @allow (create) Authenticated users can create entries with their userId or anonymous users can create entries with an empty userId.

     * @allow (delete) Only the owner of the entry can delete it.
     * @deny (create) An unauthenticated user attempts to create an entry with a userId other than "".
     * @deny (update) A user attempts to update an entry they do not own.
     * @deny (delete) A user attempts to delete an entry they do not own.
     * @principle Allows public read access and restricts write access to the owner of the data.
