/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agriassist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for submitted form entries.  Authenticated users can only create entries under their own user ID,
 * and can only modify or delete entries that they own. Unauthenticated users can also create entries,
 * but they will have an empty `userId` field, and the same restrictions apply.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All entries are stored in the top-level `/crop_data/{entryId}` collection.  Each entry contains a `userId` field indicating the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated users can submit forms, which will have an empty `userId`.
 * - Users cannot list all entries in the `/crop_data` collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field within each `/crop_data/{entryId}` document is critical for authorization. It avoids needing to query a separate `/users/{userId}` collection to determine ownership.
